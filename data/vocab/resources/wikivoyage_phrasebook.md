# Bulgarian phrasebook – Travel guide at Wikivoyage

Bulgarian (български) is a South Slavic language, thus closer to Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian than to Russian or Polish but still retaining similarities to all. Its native speakers number over 9.5 million people, as it is the national language of Republic of Bulgaria and it's spoken by the historical Bulgarian minorities in the Western Balkans, Romania, Moldova and Ukraine, and the language is still in use by many immigrants of Bulgarian origin in Argentina, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

Linguists do not agree as to whether Macedonian is a dialect of Bulgarian. Generally people from former Yugoslavia (and above all most Macedonians) disagree, while Bulgarians say that it is. In any case, the spoken languages are mutually intelligible for the most part, but their Cyrillic alphabets have diverged somewhat, with Macedonian's writing system resembling Serbo-Croatian's.

Most Bulgarian verbs carry inflection suffixes while some modal verbs use different words (typical example, the verb "съм" / "to be"). There are fewer verb tenses than in English with present, past, past continuous and future being the most commonly used, but the Slavic imperfective and perfective 'aspects' are present.

Nouns have three genders, and pronouns have genders. Adjectives must agree with the noun they modify and the first adjective takes the definite article if present. Those familiar with other Balto-Slavic languages will be surprised to discover that the noun cases are missing (except for a few vocatives) and replaced by prepositions and definite articles as post-positions like Romanian and Turkish. Unlike other Slavic languages, the infinitive has fallen out of use (which always ended in -ти). You may say "искам говорити" (I want to speak) over "искам да говоря" and be understood, but the locals may think you sound archaic or speak another Slavic language.

There are separate pronouns for "you": singular '"ти'" ("tee") and the plural "'вие'" (vee-eh). The formal 'you' is the plural form with first letter capitalized ("Вие"). Like all other Slavic languages (as well as the Romance ones), the pronoun is usually omitted due to context.

## Grammar
Bulgarian grammar is very challenging and very demanding for an English speaker. Speakers of Russian and other Slavic languages may find it easier, as they are already instinctively familiar with grammatical gender and other common concepts. Nevertheless, there are some fundamental differences in grammar - Bulgarian is a more analytic language than Russian or Polish, i.e. it relies more on prepositions rather than on a complex system of noun declensions.

### Gender
Bulgarian has three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. Identifying gender is easier than in Russian or Ukrainian. As a general rule (with a number of exceptions), masculine nouns end in a consonant, feminine nouns end in a or я, and neuter nouns end in o or e. There are no soft signs in Bulgarian, so gender is pretty simple.

### Stress
Stress in Bulgarian is irregular, just like Russian. The stress can fall anywhere within a word, and all vowels suffer 'vowel reduction'. The best way to learn new words is to learn them word for word, memorizing the position of the stress. Fortunately, in every dictionary or learning material, the stress is always indicated.

### Verb system
The verb system is perhaps the most complicated feature in modern Bulgarian, especially compared to other Slavic languages.

There are many rules to remember and since it's too complex of a subject, the most basic ideas are listed below.

This may attract the typical language lover, and if you want to become proficient in Bulgarian, you have been officially warned about how difficult its verb system is.

#### Verb tenses

| Tense | Example | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Present tense | работя | I work, I am working |
| Imperfect tense | работех | I was working |
| Aorist | работих | I worked |
| Future (positive) | ще работя | I will work |
| Future (negative) | няма да работя | I will not work |
| Future in the past (positive) | щях да работя | I was going to work |
| Future in the past (negative) | нямаше да работя | I was not going to work |
| Present perfect | работил съм | I have worked |
| Past perfect | бях работил | I had worked |
| Future perfect | ще съм работил | I will have worked |
| Future perfect in the past | щях да съм работил | I would have worked |

#### Evidentials
Bulgarian has four evidentials: indicative, renarrative, dubitative, and conclusive. In Bulgarian, you must clearly distinguish between what you have experienced and what you know from other people.

*   **Indicative**: чета (I am reading)
    *   Rough meaning: I know from my observation that I am reading something.
*   **Renarrative**: четял съм (I was reading, I read)
    *   Rough meaning: Someone (apparently) witnessed me reading.
*   **Dubitative**: бил съм четял (I was reading, I read)
    *   Rough meaning: Someone (apparently) witnessed me reading, and I doubt their claim.
    *   Note: This evidential is seldom used. In addition, it can imply or suggest that someone is lying to you.
*   **Conclusive**: четял съм (I was reading, I read)
    *   Rough meaning: I can confidently conclude that I read something.

## Pronunciation guide
Bulgarian uses the Cyrillic alphabet, and the language is famous for introducing this writing system which Russian, the other East Slavic languages and Serbo-Croatian (and other non-Slavic languages as well) would adopt later, the latter with considerable differences. The language is usually phonetic though there are few sounds denoted by digraphs and few combinations denoted by a single letter.

Stress is generally unpredictable. Fortunately, most Bulgarian dictionaries and language-books put the accent on the stressed syllable.

### Vowels
Unstressed "а" and "ъ", "о" and "у", "е" and "и" tend to be shorter and weaker compared to their stressed counterparts, approaching each other, though without merging completely, presenting a challenge for Bulgarian learners. You shall hear the 'ти' as a 'tchee' sound. Because the 't' becomes palatal and not said behind the teeth like in "ten"

*   **a** - ah [a] like in father or car (when stressed); when at the end of the word sounds like stub. Sounds like "uh" as in the Bulgarian letter 'ъ' when unstressed.
*   **e** - eh [e] like in pen or attend (when stressed); Sounds like a weak 'ee' when unstressed.
*   **и** - ee [i] like in machine or to be (when stressed); Sounds like a weak 'eh' as in the Bulgarian letter 'e' when unstressed.
*   **o** - oh [כ] like in more or score (when stressed); Sounds like a weak 'oo' when unstressed.
*   **у** - oo [u] like in rule or moon (when stressed); Sounds like a weak 'oh' when unstressed.
*   **ъ** - uh [ə] like in about (unstressed) or stub (when stressed). Sounds like a strong 'ah' when unstressed. This letter never appears at the start of a word, other than for the word "ъгъл", the Bulgarian word for "corner".

### Semivowels
*   **й** - y (i-kratko/short i) like in yes or play

Before a vowel (after another vowel or at the beginning of a word) denotes a diphthong like in "crayon" or "yes". After a vowel at the end of the word similar to English 'y' as in "play" or "fly". Can be used only next to vowels and not before or after a consonant.

### Consonants
Voiced consonants at the end of a word are pronounced as voiceless.

*   **б** - bə like in boy or rubbish, on the end of a word pronounced "p"
*   **в** - və like in ever or vineyard, on the end of a word pronounced "f"
*   **г** - gə like in gull or legacy, on the end of a word pronounced "k"
*   **д** - də like in deal or madness, on the end of a word pronounced "t"
*   **ж** - zhə like in pleasure or conclusion, on the end of a word pronounced "sh"
*   **з** - zə like in zoo or freezing, on the end of a word pronounced "s"
*   **к** - kə like in kite or rock
*   **л** - lə like in leak or look. Becoming (younger generations in some areas) closer to weak "w" as in saw (cf. Polish ł).
*   **м** - mə like in mine or ham
*   **н** - nə like in note or monkey
*   **п** - pə like in pork or comply
*   **р** - rə slightly to moderately rolled "r" as in Spanish, etc. Like in Spanish pero or otro
*   **с** - sə like in spit or cast
*   **т** - tə like in time or lightning [ at times becoming palatal with 'ти' and 'тя' ]
*   **ф** - fə like in feed or left
*   **х** - hə like in hotel or coherent [ usually aspirated similar to 'ck' in "lick"]
*   **ц** - tsə like in tsunami
*   **ч** - chə like in cheap or kitchen
*   **ш** - shə like in sheep or mishmash
*   **щ** - shtə "Sht", as in German "Still" or "Stettin" NOT shch like in Russian.
*   **ь** - ['] not a sound itself, denotes softening (palatization) of preceding consonant; unlike Russian and other Slavic languages, this is very rarely used and the softening is less dramatic in Bulgarian than in other Slavic languages;
*   **дж** - dzhə like in join or edge. Mainly used for foreign loan words.

### Common diphthongs
NOTE: In the middle or end of words, they are я-ia, йе-ie, йо/ьo-io and ю-iu

*   **я** - yah like in yacht or German Ja (when stressed); Sounds like 'yuh' when unstressed.
*   **йе** - yeh like in yes or yellow
*   **йо/ьo** - yoh like in yogurt or coyote. The latter is usually stressed
*   **ю** - yoo like in you or cute

Note that 'ю' and 'я' denote diphthongs [yoo] and [yah] after a vowel and at the beginning of a word, and tend to be pronounced 'ia' or 'io' in the middle or end of the word. The soft sign will not be included here as it is very rarely used since 1945.

### Numbers
There are longer 'formal' versions of the numbers after 10, but they are not normally used in spoken Bulgarian, even on television or by highly educated people such as university professors and literary people. Interestingly, 'thousand' is imported from Greek 'hilyades', not the Slavic 'tisushta' (Russian tysyacha).

#### Clock time
The 24-hour clock is always used in writing or when speaking of official times, such as concerts, plays or transportation; both the 24-hour and the 12-hour clock are used in informal speech. Bulgarian does not use "AM" and "PM" - instead, ambiguous hour numbers are followed by the time of day, e.g. '12 [часа] през нощта' ("12 [o'clock] at night"), '3 [часа] следобед' ("3 [o'clock] in the afternoon"), etc.

Exact clock times such as "9:31" are read as "nine [o'clock] and 31 [minutes]" - 'девет [часа] и тридесет и една [минути]', with the first numeral in masculine form, and the second - in feminine. The words for "o'clock" and "minutes" can be dropped when the context makes it clear that the numbers are a time.

When using the 12-hour clock, the minutes can also be referred to in half-hours or specific minutes before or after the hour (usually at 5 minute intervals) - e.g. 'осем и половина' (literally "eight and a half", i.e. "half past eight"), '6 без 15' (literally "6 without 15", i.e. "a quarter to six"), etc.

The standard preposition meaning "in [time]" or "at [o'clock]" is 'в / във' (v / vuhv, "in"); the longer form is used when the following word also starts with 'v', to make sure it's been heard. This can be seen in the examples below.

*   **What time is it?** - Колко е часът? (KOHL-koh eh chah-SUH?)
*   **The time is ...** - Часът е ... (chah-SUH eh ...)
*   **... 3:22** - ... три [часа] и двадесет и две [минути].
*   **... 3:30 (half past three)** - ... три и половина.
*   **... 3:45 (quarter to four)** - ... четири без петнайсет.
*   **... 3:50 (ten to four)** - ... четири без десет.
*   **The train departs at ...** - : Влакът заминава в ... (VLAH-kuht zah-mee-NAH-vah vuh)
*   **... 8 AM / PM (informal)** - ... осем [часа] сутринта / вечерта (OH-sehm [chah-SUH] soo-treen-TAH / veh-chehr-TAH)
*   **... 7:45 (AM, formal)** - ... седем часа и четиридесет и пет минути (SEH-dehm chah-SUH ee cheh-tee-ree-deh-seht ee peht mi-noo-tee)

*   **Monday** - понеделник (poh-neh-DEHL-neek)
*   **Tuesday** - вторник (VTOHR-neek)

### Colors
Like all adjectives in Bulgarian, color adjectives come in masculine, feminine and neuter forms, changing the ending of the word; the neuter forms are also used as color names. So 'черно' (CHEHR-no) is the color black, 'черна котка' (CHEHR-nah KOT-kah) is "a black cat" (as the noun "cat" is feminine), and 'черен панталон' (CHEHR-ehn pahn-tah-LON) is "a black pair of trousers" (masculine singular). Plural forms are the same for all genders - they are formed with the '-и' (-ih) suffix, e.g. 'черни обувки' (CHEHR-ni o-BOOV-ki) are "black shoes".

*   **black** - черен / черна / черно (CHEH-rehn / CHEHR-nah / CHEHR-no)
*   **white** - бял / бяла / бяло (byahl / BYAH-lah / BYAH-lo, most of the rest are formed analogically)
*   **gray** - сив / -а / -о (sihv / -ah / -o)
*   **red** - червен / -а / -о (chehr-VEHN / -ah / -o)
*   **blue** - син / синя / синьо (sihn / SIH-nyah / SIH-nyo)
*   **yellow** - жълт / -а / -о (ZH·UHLT / -ah / -o)
*   **green** - зелен / -а / -о (zeh-LEHN / -ah / -o)
*   **orange** - оранжев / -а / -о (oh-RAHN-zhehv / -ah / -o)

*   **pink** - розов / -а / -о (RO-zov / -ah / -o)
*   **brown** - кафяв / -а / -о (kah-FYAHV / -ah / -o)
