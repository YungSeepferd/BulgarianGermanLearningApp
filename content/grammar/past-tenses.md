# Past Tenses

For A2 learners it's useful to distinguish between the past aorist and the past imperfect.
The past aorist describes completed actions (Аз учих български – I studied Bulgarian), while the past imperfect describes continuous or habitual past actions (Аз учех български – I was studying Bulgarian).

## Examples

- Аз учих български. – I studied Bulgarian.
- Аз учех български. – I was studying Bulgarian.
