# Learning Methodology / Методика на учене / Lernmethode

## Evidence-Based Learning / Обучение, базирано на доказателства

This app uses scientifically proven learning techniques to maximize your language acquisition.

### Spaced Repetition System (SRS)

**What it is / Какво е:**
Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing information at increasing intervals. The app uses the SM-2 algorithm to calculate optimal review times.

**Why it works / Защо работи:**
- Combats the forgetting curve
- Strengthens long-term memory
- Focuses your time on difficult items
- Efficient use of study time

**How to use it / Как да го използвате:**
1. Study new vocabulary regularly
2. Review items when prompted
3. Rate your recall honestly (Easy, Good, Hard, Again)
4. The system adapts to your performance

### Bidirectional Learning / Двупосочно учене

**Bulgarian → German:**
Practice translating Bulgarian words and phrases into German. This helps:
- Build active German vocabulary
- Understand Bulgarian to German patterns
- Prepare for speaking German

**German → Bulgarian:**
Practice translating German words into Bulgarian. This helps:
- Build active Bulgarian vocabulary
- Understand German to Bulgarian patterns
- Prepare for speaking Bulgarian

### Level Progression / Прогресия по нива

Content is organized following the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR):

- **A1 (Beginner / Начинаещ)**: Basic everyday expressions, simple phrases
- **A2 (Elementary / Основен)**: Routine tasks, immediate needs
- **B1 (Intermediate / Среден)**: Work, school, leisure topics
- **B2 (Upper Intermediate / Горен среден)**: Complex texts, fluent interaction

### Cultural Context / Културен контекст

Language is more than just words. This app includes:
- Cultural notes explaining usage contexts
- Etymology information
- Regional variations
- Linguistic notes on grammar patterns

### Active Recall / Активно възпроизвеждане

Instead of passive reading, the app promotes active recall:
- Flashcard practice sessions
- Self-testing
- Immediate feedback
- Performance tracking

### Tips for Success / Съвети за успех

1. **Consistency is key / Последователността е ключова**: Study a little every day rather than cramming
2. **Use both directions / Използвайте двете посоки**: Practice both BG→DE and DE→BG
3. **Focus on context / Фокусирайте се върху контекста**: Read the cultural notes
4. **Be honest with ratings / Бъдете честни с оценките**: Accurate self-assessment helps the algorithm
5. **Review regularly / Преглеждайте редовно**: Don't skip review sessions

### Research References / Изследователски референции

The methodology is based on:
- Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve research
- Supermemo SM-2 algorithm (Wozniak, 1990)
- CEFR language levels (Council of Europe)
- Best practices in second language acquisition
