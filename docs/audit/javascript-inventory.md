# JavaScript Module Inventory

Last Updated: 2025-10-19

## Scope

This audit covers every JavaScript file under `assets/js/` and `assets/js/modules/`. For each module the table captures its purpose, load path, dependency usage, status classification, and initial removal recommendation. Usage counts are based on Hugo template references, shortcode inclusions, or direct imports observed during the audit snapshot (commit time stamps from `stat`).

## Summary Findings

- **Active entry points:** `assets/js/app.js`, `assets/js/code.js`, `assets/js/language-toggle.js`, `assets/js/language-toggle-confirmation.js`, and `assets/js/onboarding.js` are loaded globally from `layouts/_default/baseof.html:41-57`.
- **Practice stack:** `assets/js/unified-practice-session.js`, `assets/js/enhanced-bidirectional-system.js`, and `assets/js/enhanced-spaced-repetition.js` are loaded by `layouts/practice/single.html:272-288` for the modern session flow. They depend on the unified practice session class and SM-2 helpers exported on `window`.
- **Vocabulary page:** `assets/js/modules/vocabulary-page.js`, `assets/js/enhanced-vocab-cards.js`, `assets/js/vocabulary-adapter.js`, and shared cultural data scripts are loaded via `layouts/vocabulary/list.html:166-199`.
- **Legacy / fallback code:** `assets/js/flashcards.js`, `assets/js/practice.js`, `assets/js/bidirectional-flashcards.js`, `assets/js/session-stats-dashboard.js`, `assets/js/home.js`, and the modules bundle in `assets/js/modules/` (other than `vocabulary-page.js`) are not referenced by current templates. They appear to be legacy or experimental slices preserved for backwards compatibility but no longer wired up.
- **SM-2 duplication:** Both `assets/js/spaced-repetition.js` and `assets/js/enhanced-spaced-repetition.js` implement SM-2 variants. Only the enhanced version is loaded by production templates; the legacy version is reachable through the `flashcards.js` import chain and the test template (`layouts/test-flashcards/single.html`).
- **Namespace consistency:** Live modules expose globals on `window.*` (e.g., `window.EnhancedPracticeSession`, `window.VocabularyAdapter`). Future refactoring should consolidate module loading to ES module syntax with bundling or consistent resource pipelines.

## Dependency Notes

- **Global namespace:** Many legacy files rely on globals (`window.BgDeApp`, `window.languageToggle`). The enhanced stack creates `window.EnhancedPracticeSession`, `window.VocabularyAdapter`, and `window.VocabularyPageModule`. Any consolidation must carefully migrate these globals or introduce a compatibility adapter.
- **SM-2 duplication:**
  - `assets/js/enhanced-spaced-repetition.js` exports `window.EnhancedSpacedRepetition` with the new data shape (`{ item_id, interval, ease_factor, repetitions, next_review, last_review }`).
  - `assets/js/spaced-repetition.js` exports `window.spacedRepetition` (legacy).
  - `assets/js/app.js` still contains an inline `SpacedRepetition` class. These three implementations should be reconciled in future slices.
- **Legacy practice fallback:** `layouts/_shortcodes/flashcards.html` still calls `window.BgDeApp.initPractice()` as a fallback if enhanced modules fail to load. That flow depends on `assets/js/practice.js` and `assets/js/spaced-repetition.js`, implying some legacy compatibility requirement.

## Import Chain Highlights

- `layouts/_default/baseof.html` → `app.js`, `code.js`, `language-toggle.js`, `language-toggle-confirmation.js`, `onboarding.js`.
- `layouts/practice/single.html` (JS layout) → `enhanced-spaced-repetition.js` → `window.EnhancedSpacedRepetition`; `enhanced-bidirectional-system.js` → event bus; `enhanced-practice-session.js` → session UI.
- `layouts/vocabulary/list.html` → `enhanced-bidirectional-system.js`, `vocabulary-adapter.js`, `enhanced-vocab-cards.js`, `modules/vocabulary-page.js`.
- `layouts/_shortcodes/flashcards.html` → fallback `window.BgDeApp.initPractice()` which depends on globals defined in legacy `assets/js/practice.js` chain (requires confirmation).
- `layouts/test-flashcards/single.html` → `flashcards.js` (ES module importing `spaced-repetition.js`, `language-toggle.js`, `speech-recognition.js`). This template appears to be a sandbox for manual testing and not part of production build.

## Recommendations

- **Document legacy stack dependencies:** Update `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` to clarify which templates still rely on `window.BgDeApp` and whether those code paths are officially supported.
- **Plan SM-2 consolidation:** Schedule a refactoring slice to unify `spaced-repetition.js`, the `SpacedRepetition` class inside `app.js`, and `enhanced-spaced-repetition.js` into a single module exposed through a compatibility wrapper.
- **Evaluate orphan modules:** Confirm whether `assets/js/modules/*.js` (excluding `vocabulary-page.js`) can be removed or archived. If they are retained for reference, mark them as deprecated in code headers and docs.
- **Modernize imports:** Consider converting legacy inline ESM import usage (`vocab-cards.js` and `flashcards.js`) into Hugo pipeline-managed bundles to satisfy browsers without native module support, or enforce module loading via `<script type="module">` in templates.
- **Create removal checklist:** Before deleting any DEPRECATED/CANDIDATE modules, verify there are no references in Markdown content, shortcodes, or the published `public/` artifact. Document impact assessments in `docs/REFACTORING_LOG.md` when executed.

## Next Steps

Pending user approval, proceed with the next audit slice (SCSS or templates) while keeping this inventory as the baseline for future refactoring roadmaps.
