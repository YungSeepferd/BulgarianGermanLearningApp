# Hugo Templates Inventory

Last Updated: 2025-10-19

## Scope

Audit of all Hugo layout files under `layouts/`, including defaults, section templates, partials, shortcodes, experimental templates, and JSON outputs. Each entry records purpose, usage, and retirement recommendations.

## Summary Findings

- **Active foundation:** `layouts/_default/baseof.html` orchestrates global partials (`header`, `footer`, `pwa-register`) and the CSS/JS pipeline. `_default/list.html` and `_default/single.html` serve as fallbacks for generic content.
- **Dedicated sections:** `layouts/vocabulary/list.html`, `layouts/grammar/list.html`, and `layouts/practice/single.html` implement key experiences with embedded data scripts and JS hooks. `layouts/practice/single.html` mixes inline CSS/JS that should migrate to assets in future slices.
- **API & PWA assets:** JSON outputs (`layouts/_default/vocabulary-api.json`, `layouts/_default/manifest.json`, `layouts/_default/sw.js`) power the SPA-like features and must remain aligned with `static/manifest.webmanifest` and `static/sw.js`.
- **Shortcode ecosystem:** Vocabulary and flashcard shortcodes are widely used; the legacy `flashcards` shortcode still depends on `window.BgDeApp.initPractice` fallback.
- **Experimental templates:** `layouts/test-flashcards/single.html` is isolated for sandboxing JS (loads legacy modules) and may be removed or moved under `content/` drafts when legacy flow is retired.
- **Orphan layouts:** `layouts/offline/single.html` appears unused now that `/offline/` is served from `content/offline.md` via `_default/single.html`. Confirm before removal.

## Observations

- **Inline assets:** `layouts/practice/single.html` and `layouts/_shortcodes/flashcards.html` embed inline scripts/styles. Later refactoring should move these into compiled assets to maintain single source of truth.
- **Duplicate offline layouts:** Both `_default/offline.html` and `offline/single.html` exist, yet the site uses `content/offline.md` with default layout. Confirm which version is canonical.
- **Service worker duplication:** The layout-provided `sw.js` is likely outdated; the active service worker resides in `static/sw.js`. Removing duplicate outputs reduces confusion.
- **Legacy testing layout:** `layouts/test-flashcards/single.html` is valuable during transition but should be marked deprecated in docs and excluded from production navigation.

## Recommendations

- **Document template roles:** Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` or `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` to clarify which templates power major flows versus legacy backups.
- **Plan cleanup slices:** Include removal or consolidation of redundant offline layouts and the unused `_default/sw.js` in the refactoring roadmap after verifying no build steps depend on them.
- **Refactor inline assets:** Schedule a future slice to migrate inline CSS/JS into `assets/` bundles, reducing maintenance overhead.

## Next Steps

Await user direction on whether to continue with the next audit slice (e.g., static assets or data files). Track deprecation decisions in `docs/DEPRECATIONS.md` during subsequent phases.
