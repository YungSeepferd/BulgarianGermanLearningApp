# Documentation Suite Review

Last Updated: 2025-10-19

## Scope

Inventory core documentation under `docs/`, identify outdated or redundant files, and map coverage across development, testing, deployment, and audit records. Highlight gaps and recommend consolidations.

## Summary Findings

- **High-volume docs:** `docs/` contains 30+ Markdown files, including historical reports (phase completion, testing summaries), active guides (`DEVELOPMENT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROGRAMMING_LINKS.md`), and recent audit outputs under `docs/audit/`.
- **Redundancy risk:** Multiple testing-related summaries (`COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_REPORT.md`, `FINAL_TESTING_SUMMARY.md`, `FINAL_LOCAL_TEST_SUCCESS.md`, `COMPLETE_LOCAL_TEST_PLAN.md`, `TESTING.md`) overlap; need consolidation to a single living testing guide.
- **Outdated status reports:** Files like `PHASE_1_2_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`, `PHASE_3_4_TEST_REPORT.md`, and `FINAL_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` capture past milestones but may no longer reflect current app state. Should be archived or clearly marked historical.
- **Documentation hierarchy:** `DOCS_ORGANIZATION.md` outlines structure but not updated to include new audit files; `development-notes.md` duplicative with `docs/notes/TODAY.md` and `docs/notes/NEXT.md`.
- **Knowledge gaps:** Missing dedicated docs for enhanced bidirectional system architecture and SM-2 storage expectations; insights live in audit docs instead of canonical references.

## Observations

- **Archive sprawl:** Many milestone reports clutter root directory; move into `docs/archive/` to streamline navigation and reduce confusion for new contributors.
- **Living docs vs reports:** Distinguish between actively maintained guides (development, architecture, testing) and historical reports. Use frontmatter or badges (e.g., `Status: Historical`) to signal maintenance expectations.
- **Missing cross-links:** Key docs (`DEVELOPMENT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`) do not reference new audit outputs or enhanced features. Add links for discoverability.
- **Documentation debt:** No dedicated documentation for enhanced bidirectional system architecture (currently only in audit/test plan). Create new section or doc summarizing data flow, localStorage schema, cultural notes usage, referencing `docs/audit/data-schema.md`.

## Recommendations

- **Archive cleanup:** Relocate historical reports (`FINAL_*`, `PHASE_*`, `POST_FIX_*`, `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`, `LOCAL_TESTING_BUGS.md`, `BUG_FIXES_SESSION_REPORT.md`) into `docs/archive/reports/`. Update `DOCS_ORGANIZATION.md` to reflect new structure.
- **Living testing guide:** Consolidate testing documentation into `docs/TESTING.md` and `docs/COMPLETE_LOCAL_TEST_PLAN.md`. Convert redundant summaries into links or appendices under archive.
- **Update core guides:** Refresh `docs/README.md`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to reference enhanced vocabulary, SM-2, and audit outcomes. Include note about audit documents in `PROGRAMMING_LINKS.md`.
- **Documentation ownership:** Add status tags or maintainers to major docs to ensure ongoing updates (e.g., `Status: Maintained`, `Owner: Data Team`).
- **Integrate audit outputs:** Create index in `docs/audit/README.md` (future task) summarizing each audit slice with links for quick reference.

## Next Steps

Upon approval, continue with Audit Slice 8 (Security & dependency audit). Consider scheduling a documentation refactor sprint to implement moves and consolidations.
