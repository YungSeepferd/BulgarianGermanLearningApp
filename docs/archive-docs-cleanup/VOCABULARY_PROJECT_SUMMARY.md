## 🎓 Key Insights from Research

### 1. **Vocabulary Size Matters**
Research shows strong correlation between vocabulary size and CEFR proficiency:
- A1: Survival communication (650-750 words)
- A2: Basic conversations (1,300 words)
- B1: Independence threshold (2,400 words)
- B2: Fluency begins (3,800 words)
- C1: Advanced proficiency (5,000 words)
- C2: Near-native mastery (5,000+ words)

### 2. **Cultural Context is Critical**
Vocabulary learning is significantly enhanced when cultural context is provided:
- Communication style differences (direct vs indirect)
- Time orientation (punctuality expectations)
- Social hierarchy (formality levels)
- Food culture (meal timing, traditions)
- Work-life balance concepts

### 3. **Bidirectional Learning Requires Different Notes**
- Bulgarian speakers learning German need:
  - German grammar explanations in Bulgarian
  - Comparison to Bulgarian structures
  - Common mistakes to avoid
  
- German speakers learning Bulgarian need:
  - Bulgarian grammar in German
  - Pronunciation guidance (Cyrillic)
  - Stress pattern explanations

### 4. **Frequency ≠ Difficulty**
Some very frequent words are actually quite difficult:
- Modal verbs (искам, мога, трябва)
- Aspect pairs (Bulgarian perfective/imperfective)
- Cases and articles (German)

### 5. **Etymology Aids Retention**
Including word origins helps learners:
- Remember relationships between words
- Understand semantic shifts
- Make connections across languages
- Appreciate cultural influences (Turkish, Russian, etc.)
