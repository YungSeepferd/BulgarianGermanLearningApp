# 🔧 Fix Applied: Temporary Revert to Learn Theme

## ✅ Your Site Should Work Now

I've temporarily changed `hugo.toml` back to use `theme = 'learn'` so you can continue working.

Run this to test:
```bash
hugo server -D
```

Your site should now load without errors! 🎉

## 🚀 To Complete the Relearn Migration (When Ready)

### Step 1: Run Git Commands

Open your terminal and run these commands:

```bash
cd "/Users/dinz/Coding Projects/BulgariaLearn/BulgarianApp-Fresh"

# Remove old Learn theme (it will be replaced)
git submodule deinit -f themes/learn
git rm -f themes/learn
rm -rf .git/modules/themes/learn

# Add Relearn theme
git submodule add https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn.git themes/relearn
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Step 2: Update hugo.toml

After the commands above succeed, change line 5 in `hugo.toml` from:
```toml
theme = 'learn'
```

To:
```toml
theme = 'relearn'
```

### Step 3: Test

```bash
hugo mod clean
rm -rf public/ resources/
hugo server -D
```

## 🎯 Why This Happened

The error occurred because:
1. ✅ Configuration was updated to use 'relearn'
2. ❌ But the Relearn theme files weren't downloaded yet
3. ❌ Git submodule commands weren't run

**The git submodule commands need to be run manually** because they modify your git repository structure.

---

## 📋 What's Ready for Migration

Everything else is prepared:
- ✅ Custom Relearn styles created
- ✅ Multi-language config ready
- ✅ GitHub Actions updated
- ✅ Documentation complete

You just need to:
1. Run the git commands (5 minutes)
2. Change `theme = 'learn'` to `theme = 'relearn'`
3. Test locally

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

### Error: "fatal: No url found for submodule path"
**Solution**: The old submodule wasn't removed properly. Try:
```bash
git submodule deinit -f --all
rm -rf .git/modules/themes
git rm -rf themes/learn
rm -rf themes/learn
```

### Error: "already exists in the index"
**Solution**: 
```bash
git rm -rf themes/learn
git rm -rf themes/relearn
# Then try the add command again
```

### Error: Permission denied
**Solution**: 
```bash
sudo chown -R $USER themes/
# Then try again
```

## 💡 Alternative: Manual Download (If Git Issues)

If git submodules are problematic, you can manually download:

```bash
cd themes/
rm -rf learn
git clone https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn.git relearn
cd ..
```

Then update `hugo.toml` to `theme = 'relearn'`
