## 1. Core Grammatical Categories

### A. Nouns

#### German Nouns

German nouns are categorized into three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. The gender often correlates with noun endings: masculine nouns frequently end in *-er*, feminine nouns in *-in* or *-ung*, and neuter nouns in *-chen* or *-lein*. However, exceptions abound, and semantic or historical factors also influence gender assignment.

German nouns decline across four cases: nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive. The case system signals the grammatical function of nouns within sentences, affecting articles, adjectives, and pronouns. For example, the masculine noun *der Stein* (the stone) appears as *den Stein* (accusative) and *dem Stein* (dative). Plural formation follows specific patterns, such as adding *-e*, *-er*, or *-n*, depending on gender and noun structure.

German compound nouns are formed by combining two or more words, often with the last word determining the gender of the compound. For example, *Haustür* (house door) combines *Haus* (house) and *Tür* (door), inheriting the feminine gender of *Tür*.

**German Noun Gender & Plural Patterns**

| Gender | Typical Endings | Plural Endings | Example (Singular/Plural) |  
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------------------------|  
| Masculine | -er, -ling, -ig | -e, -er | der Hund / die Hunde (dog/dogs) |  
| Feminine | -in, -ung, -heit | -en, -n | die Frau / die Frauen (woman/women) |  
| Neuter | -chen, -lein, -um | -e, -er | das Kind / die Kinder (child/children) |  

#### Bulgarian Nouns

Bulgarian nouns also have three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter, generally determined by endings: masculine nouns end in consonants, feminine nouns in *-а/я*, and neuter nouns in *-е/о*. Bulgarian has largely lost its historical case system, retaining only the vocative case for direct address, which can differ from the nominative form (e.g., *момче* [boy] remains *момче* in vocative).

Bulgarian nouns express definiteness through postfixed definite articles: *-ът/ят* (masculine singular), *-та* (feminine singular), *-то* (neuter singular), and *-те* (plural). Plural formation follows patterns such as adding *-и* or replacing singular endings (e.g., *стол → столове* [chair → chairs], *книга → книги* [book → books]).

**Bulgarian Noun Gender & Plural Patterns**

| Gender | Typical Endings | Plural Endings | Example (Singular/Plural) |  
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------------------------|  
| Masculine | Consonant | -и, -ове | човек / хора (person/people) |  
| Feminine | -а, -я | -и | книга / книги (book/books) |  
| Neuter | -е, -о | -а, -та | куче / кучета (dog/dogs) |

### B. Adjectives

#### German Adjectives

German adjectives agree with nouns in gender, number, and case, and their endings change accordingly. Adjectives can take weak, mixed, or strong declensions depending on the presence and type of article (definite, indefinite, possessive). For example, *der gute Hund* (the good dog) uses weak declension, while *ein guter Hund* (a good dog) uses mixed declension.

Comparative and superlative forms are created with the suffix *-er* and the prefix *am* + suffix *-sten*, respectively (e.g., *groß → größer → am größten*). Adverbs are formed by adding the suffix *-lich* (e.g., *schnell → schnelllich*).

#### Bulgarian Adjectives

Bulgarian adjectives agree with nouns in gender, number, and definiteness, and are usually placed before the noun. The definite article attaches to the adjective when modifying a definite noun (e.g., *добрият човек* [the good man]). Comparative and superlative forms are formed with the prefixes *по-* and *най-*, respectively (e.g., *добър → по-добър → най-добър* [good → better → best]).

---

### C. Pronouns

#### German Pronouns

German pronouns are highly inflected across four cases and vary by gender and number. Personal pronouns change form based on their function: nominative (subject), accusative (direct object), dative (indirect object), and genitive (possessive). For example, *ich* (I) becomes *mich* (me), *mir* (to me), and *meiner* (mine).

Possessive, demonstrative, relative, reflexive, interrogative, and indefinite pronouns all follow specific declension patterns. For example, *mein* (my) changes to *meine* (feminine), *mein* (neuter), and *meine* (plural).

#### Bulgarian Pronouns

Bulgarian pronouns also vary by gender, number, definiteness, and case, but Bulgarian distinguishes long (stressed) and short (unstressed, clitic) forms. Personal pronouns have nominative, accusative, and dative forms (e.g., *аз* [I] → *мен/ме* [me], *ми* [to me]). Possessive pronouns agree with the noun they modify and can be definite or indefinite. Reflexive pronouns indicate actions directed back to the subject (e.g., *себе си* [oneself]).

---

### D. Verbs

#### German Verbs

German verbs are conjugated according to tense, mood, voice, person, and number. They are classified as regular (weak), irregular (strong), and mixed verbs. Regular verbs follow predictable conjugation patterns, while irregular verbs require memorization due to stem changes. Modal verbs (e.g., *können*, *müssen*) and auxiliary verbs (*haben*, *sein*, *werden*) are essential for forming compound tenses and moods.

German has six tenses in the indicative mood and additional moods (subjunctive, imperative). The present tense is formed by adding personal endings to the verb stem, while the future tense uses *werden* + infinitive. The passive voice is formed with *werden* + past participle.

#### Bulgarian Verbs

Bulgarian verbs are divided into three conjugations based on their thematic vowels in the present tense. They have nine tenses, three moods, and six non-finite forms. The present tense is formed using the verb stem with personal endings. Bulgarian distinguishes perfective and imperfective aspects, which are crucial for verb usage.

Auxiliary verbs *съм* (to be) and *ща* (to want) are used to construct complex verb forms. Bulgarian verbs do not change for gender in the present tense, simplifying conjugation.

---

### E. Prepositions

#### German Prepositions

German prepositions govern specific cases and indicate location, direction, or relationships. For example, *in* governs dative or accusative depending on motion, *mit* governs dative, and *durch* governs accusative. Prepositions are essential for sentence structure and meaning.

#### Bulgarian Prepositions

Bulgarian prepositions include *в* (in), *на* (on/at), *със* (with), and *до* (next to). They indicate location, direction, and relationships within sentences. Bulgarian prepositions are used flexibly and often differ from English equivalents.

---

### F. Sentence Structure & Syntax

#### German Sentence Structure

German sentence structure follows the V2 rule: the finite verb is always in the second position in main clauses. Subordinate clauses are introduced by conjunctions or relative pronouns, and the verb moves to the end. Word order is flexible for emphasis but must maintain grammatical correctness.

Negation uses *nicht* before the verb or adjective, with double negatives for emphasis. German also uses *kein* for negating nouns with indefinite articles.

#### Bulgarian Sentence Structure

Bulgarian sentence structure is highly flexible due to strong subject-verb agreement, allowing variations such as SVO or SOV for emphasis. Subordinate clauses are introduced by conjunctions like *че* (that), *защото* (because), and *макар че* (although), with the verb at the end.

Negation uses *не* before the verb or adjective, with double negatives for emphasis. Bulgarian allows for expressive word order changes to emphasize different sentence components.

## 2. Vocabulary Characteristics

### A. Word Formation

#### German Word Formation

German extensively uses prefixes (e.g., *un-*, *ver-*, *be-*) and suffixes (e.g., *-heit*, *-keit*, *-ung*) to create new words. Compound nouns are formed by combining words, often with the last word determining gender. False friends with English (e.g., *Gift* = poison) are common pitfalls.

#### Bulgarian Word Formation

Bulgarian uses prefixes (e.g., *не-* for negation, *пре-* for excess) and suffixes (e.g., *-ост* for abstract nouns, *-тел* for agent nouns). Loanwords from Turkish, Russian, and English are adapted to Bulgarian phonetics and grammar.

| Business | Arbeit (work), Büro (office), Geschäft (business) | работа (work), офис (office), бизнес (business) |  

---

### C. Register & Style

Both languages distinguish formal and informal registers. German uses *du* (informal) and *Sie* (formal) for address, while Bulgarian uses *ти* (informal) and *Вие* (formal). Dialectal variations exist in both languages, influencing vocabulary and pronunciation.
