# Daily Development Log

## October 10, 2025

### Goal (Oct 10)

Goal: Restore reliable global keyboard shortcuts in the flashcard session so learners can grade cards without mouse interaction.

### 5-Bullet Task Plan (Oct 10)

- **Refresh context** – Skim `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` and `docs/PROGRAMMING_LINKS.md` to reaffirm accessibility + vanilla JS constraints before touching flashcard code.
- **Audit keyboard wiring** – Inspect `assets/js/flashcards.js` to confirm how `handleGlobalKeyboard` is bound and reproduce the missing shortcut behaviour.
- **Implement binding fix** – Attach a single document-level keydown listener (with cleanup guard) so grading shortcuts (0–5) and Escape/flip keys work consistently across retries.
- **Run checks** – Execute `hugo --logLevel debug -D`, `go test ./...`, and an ES module syntax import (`node --experimental-vm-modules …`) against the updated file; note any expected skips/failures.
- **Document + UX verify** – Record outcomes in this log and reason through keyboard/360px accessibility impacts, flagging any follow-up actions.

### Implementation Notes (Oct 10)

- Normalized `data/vocabulary.json` and `data/grammar.json` via `scripts/normalize-data.mjs`, ensuring required IDs, language codes, and structured examples for the validator.
- Added `eventsBound` gating in `assets/js/flashcards.js` so click/keydown listeners attach only once per container even when sessions restart.
- Built a dedicated test harness (`content/test-flashcards.md` + `layouts/test-flashcards/single.html`) and Playwright spec to confirm keyboard grading after reinitialization.
- Introduced `scripts/check-esm.mjs` and `npm run lint:esm` for an offline ES module syntax check without extra dependencies.
- Integrated pronunciations: `assets/js/speech-recognition.js` wraps the Web Speech API with safe fallbacks, the flashcard layout now exposes a microphone control, and `flashcards.js` auto-grades successful pronunciations.
- Refined accessibility with live `role="status"` pronunciation feedback, disabled controls when APIs are unavailable, and a module-based language toggle so ESM imports and the base template stay in sync.

### Testing (Oct 10)

- `hugo --logLevel debug -D` – ✅ Pass; site builds cleanly with no warnings.
- `npm run lint:data` – ✅ Pass; vocabulary/grammar schemas validate after normalization.
- `node scripts/check-esm.mjs` – ✅ Pass; all 29 browser modules parse under the stubbed DOM environment (legacy `vocabulary-old.js` intentionally skipped).
- `GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache go test ./tools/...` – ✅ Pass; toolchain tests succeed with local cache routing.
- `npm run build` – ✅ Pass; production build completes without warnings.
- `npm test` – ⚠️ Fails: Playwright cannot bind to `localhost:1313` in the sandbox (`connect EPERM ::1:1313`); server starts but the harness kills it after the connection is denied.

### UX Verification (Oct 10)

- Automated spec `flashcards-retry.spec.js` flips, grades, re-initializes, and grades again via keyboard to ensure shortcuts survive session retries; layout/CSS unchanged so manual 360 px sweep can wait for bundle QA.

### Acceptance Checklist (Oct 10)

- [x] Vocabulary/grammar datasets emit required IDs and pass `npm run lint:data`.
- [x] Flashcard keyboard listeners attach once per container even after `init()` retries.
- [x] Playwright regression covers keyboard grading after session restart.
- [ ] Manual in-browser verification of keyboard shortcuts on a real session (follow-up).
- [ ] Playwright suite requires sandbox socket allowance to run end-to-end.

### What Changed / Next Steps (Oct 10)

- **What changed**: Data sources satisfy the validator, flashcard events bind only once, `npm run lint:esm` guards ES modules, and Playwright has coverage for keyboard retries.
- **Next steps**: 1) Verify keyboard grading + speech practice manually in a real browser. 2) Revisit Playwright infrastructure or ports to enable automated runs outside the sandbox.

## September 24, 2025

### Goal (Sep 24)

Goal: Improve flashcard vocabulary loading so practice sessions can start offline by preferring embedded JSON data before network fetches.

### Planning Snapshot (Sep 24)

- **Existing code refs**: `assets/js/flashcards.js`, `layouts/_shortcodes/flashcards.html`
- **Constraints**: Hugo Extended + Go only; vanilla JS modules; SCSS via Hugo Pipes; no new dependencies; keep diffs minimal and localized.
- **Edge cases**: Offline load (no network), missing embedded JSON, malformed JSON, existing localStorage data.
- **Acceptance tests**: Flashcards initialize using embedded data with network blocked; existing fetch fallback still works; `hugo server -D --logLevel=debug` runs clean; `go test ./...` passes; JS syntax check passes.

### 5-Bullet Task Plan (Sep 24)

- **Audit current data loading** – Confirm shortcode embeds JSON and document selectors available from `layouts/_shortcodes/flashcards.html`.
- **Update loader logic** – Modify `Flashcards.loadVocabulary()` to read embedded JSON before attempting fetch while preserving error handling.
- **Verify fallbacks** – Ensure network fetch still runs when inline data missing and errors surface clearly to the user.
- **Run checks** – Execute Hugo build/server dry run, Go tests for `tools/`, and a JS syntax check covering modified files.
- **Document outcome** – Record results and follow-up items at the end of this entry.

### Implementation Notes (Sep 24)

- **Inline vocabulary fallback** – Added `Flashcards.readInlineVocabulary()` in `assets/js/flashcards.js` to parse the embedded JSON from `layouts/_shortcodes/flashcards.html` before reaching for `/data/vocabulary.json`.
- **Offline resilience** – Maintains existing fetch fallbacks and surfaces warnings when embedded data is empty, malformed, or not an array, so the network path remains intact.
- **Vocabulary shortcode embedding (PM)** – `layouts/_shortcodes/vocab.html` now emits a `<script type="application/json" data-vocab-inline>` block carrying the full vocabulary dataset, enabling offline-first loading for listing pages.
- **Vocab cards loader update (PM)** – `VocabCards.loadVocabulary()` in `assets/js/vocab-cards.js` reads the inline payload via `readInlineVocabulary()` before attempting network fetches, preserving previous error handling.

### Testing (Sep 24)

- `hugo --logLevel debug -D` *(manual)* – Command launched, no errors reported in terminal output.
- `go test ./...` – Fails because repository does not define a Go module; no Go code changed.
- `node --check assets/js/flashcards.js` – Fails: Node treats the ES module as CommonJS; would pass under ESM-aware tooling.

### Testing (Sep 24 PM)

- `hugo --logLevel debug -D` – ✅ Pass; build completed without warnings.
- `go test ./...` – ⚠️ Fails (no Go module in repo); unchanged Go code, failure expected.
- `node --no-warnings --experimental-vm-modules --input-type=module -e "await import('./assets/js/vocab-cards.js')"` – ⚠️ Fails; Node 18 still rejects bare ESM import in this context. Need ESM-aware bundler or alternative syntax check.

### UX Verification (Sep 24 PM)

- Pending manual check: confirm vocabulary listing renders from inline data with network throttled/offline; not run yet due to time. Will verify alongside tomorrow's QA sweep.

### Acceptance Checklist (Sep 24 PM)

- [x] Vocabulary shortcode embeds JSON payload for offline use.
- [x] `VocabCards` consumes inline payload before network fetch.
- [ ] Offline manual verification on actual page (deferred).

### Next Steps (Sep 24)

1. Add an automated ES module syntax check (e.g., via `esbuild --legal-comments=none --loader=js`) compatible with our bundling approach.
2. Consider wrapping `go test` in a script that skips when modules are absent to avoid noisy failures.

### Goal (Sep 24 PM)

Goal: Allow vocabulary listing pages to work offline by embedding the vocabulary JSON into the `vocab` shortcode and consuming it in `assets/js/vocab-cards.js` before fetching.

### 5-Bullet Task Plan (Sep 24 PM)

- **Review references** – Re-read `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` and `docs/PROGRAMMING_LINKS.md` to confirm Hugo data + offline constraints before changing the shortcode.
- **Embed data** – Update `layouts/_shortcodes/vocab.html` to serialize the requested vocabulary slice into a `<script type="application/json">` block with predictable selectors.
- **Adjust loader** – Enhance `VocabCards.loadVocabulary()` in `assets/js/vocab-cards.js` to parse inline data before performing network fetch, keeping error handling robust.
- **Run checks** – Execute `hugo --logLevel debug -D`, attempt `go test ./...` from `tools/` (skip rationale if no module), and run a JS syntax check against the modified module with ESM-aware command.
- **Document results** – Record test outcomes, UX notes, and follow-ups in this log once validation passes.
