# Daily Development - August 25, 2025

## Today's Goal

Complete pending changes and implement session recovery feature for the Bulgarian-German app.

## Tech Stack Confirmed

- **Hugo Extended** (v0.128.0+) - Static site generator with SCSS via Hugo Pipes
- **Go** (v1.21+) - Backend tools and spaced repetition algorithms  
- **Vanilla JS modules** - Client-side interactivity, no external frameworks
- **SCSS** - Styling processed through Hugo Pipes
- **GitHub Pages** - Deployment via GitHub Actions

## 5-Bullet Task Plan

• **Review and Commit Pending Changes** - Address uncommitted changes in enhanced-practice-session.js and flashcard SCSS to ensure clean working state

• **Implement Session Recovery Feature** - Add localStorage-based session recovery so users can resume interrupted practice sessions after browser refresh or accidental navigation

• **Enhance Error Handling** - Improve error handling for audio playback failures and missing data with proper user feedback

• **Test Mobile Responsiveness** - Verify 360px viewport compatibility and keyboard accessibility on mobile devices

• **Documentation Updates** - Clean up any remaining markdown lint issues and update progress tracking

## What Changed

- **Session Recovery Implementation**: Added localStorage-based session recovery with auto-save every 10 seconds
  - Users can now resume interrupted practice sessions after browser refresh or navigation
  - Recovery dialog shows progress and allows users to continue or start fresh
  - Sessions expire after 1 hour to prevent stale data
  - Auto-save stops and clears when sessions complete or are manually ended

- **Enhanced Keyboard Navigation**: Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for accessibility
  - Space/Enter to flip cards, 1/2 to grade responses, H for hints, Escape to end session
  - Arrow key navigation between response buttons with visual focus indicators
  - Keyboard navigation class added for accessibility compliance

- **Mobile Responsiveness Improvements**: Enhanced 360px viewport compatibility
  - Touch targets meet 44px minimum requirement for accessibility
  - Improved card sizing and button layout for small screens
  - Better text scaling and spacing for mobile devices

- **Progress Tracking Fixes**: Corrected progress calculation and response timing
  - Progress bar now shows actual completion vs current position
  - Per-item timing for accurate response time measurement
  - Immediate UI updates after each response

- **Testing and Validation**: All systems verified working
  - Hugo server runs cleanly with no console errors (✓)
  - Go tools tests pass successfully (✓)
  - JavaScript syntax validation passes (✓)
  - Mobile viewport tested via browser preview (✓)

## Next Steps

1. **Audio Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling for audio playback failures with user feedback
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading for cultural context data to improve initial page load times
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Add detailed learning analytics and progress visualization charts
4. **Offline Support**: Enhance PWA capabilities for fully offline vocabulary practice sessions
5. **User Testing**: Conduct usability testing with the new session recovery feature
