# ESLint Rule Deviations Documentation

This document outlines intentional deviations from ESLint rules in the Bulgarian-German Learning App codebase.

## 1. Generated Type Declaration Files (`.d.ts`)

### Files Affected:
- `src/lib/schemas/lesson.d.ts`
- `src/lib/schemas/localStorage.d.ts`
- `src/lib/schemas/unified-vocabulary.d.ts`
- `src/lib/game.svelte.d.ts`
- `src/lib/state/app.svelte.d.ts`
- `src/lib/utils.d.ts`

### Rule Deviations:
- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`: These files are automatically generated from Zod schemas and contain `any` types that are part of the Zod type inference system.

### Reason:
These files are generated from Zod schema definitions and represent the inferred TypeScript types. The `any` types appear due to Zod's type transformation system and cannot be easily eliminated without changing the Zod schema definitions or the type generation process.

### Status:
✅ **Intentional** - These are generated files and the `any` types are part of the Zod type inference system.

---

## 2. External Library Files

### Files Affected:
- `src/paraglide/runtime.d.ts`

### Rule Deviations:
- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`: This file is part of the Paraglide internationalization library and contains `any` types.

### Reason:
This file is part of an external library (Paraglide) and should not be modified. The `any` types are part of the library's type definitions.

### Status:
✅ **Intentional** - External library file that should not be modified.

---

## 3. Script and Debug Files

### Files Affected:
- Various files in `scripts/` directory
- Debug files (`debug-enhanced-lesson.ts`, `debug-template.ts`, etc.)

### Rule Deviations:
- `no-console`: These files intentionally use console statements for debugging and migration purposes.

### Reason:
These files are:
- Debug scripts used during development
- Migration scripts that need to log progress and errors
- Test scripts that use console output for verification
- One-time data transformation scripts

### Status:
✅ **Intentional** - These files are not part of the production codebase and use console statements for legitimate debugging and migration purposes.

---

## 4. Generated JavaScript Files

### Files Affected:
- `src/lib/data/db.svelte.js`

### Rule Deviations:
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`: Generated files may contain unused variables that were fixed in the source files.

### Reason:
This is a generated file from the Svelte compiler. The source file (`db.svelte.ts`) has been fixed, but the generated file may still contain the old code until it's recompiled.

### Status:
✅ **Temporary** - Will be resolved when the file is recompiled. The source file has been fixed.

## Summary

| Deviation Type | Status | Reason |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| Generated `.d.ts` files | ✅ Intentional | Zod type inference system |
| External library files | ✅ Intentional | External library definitions |
| Script/debug files | ✅ Intentional | Debugging and migration purposes |
| Generated `.js` files | ✅ Temporary | Will be resolved on recompilation |

All deviations are intentional and serve specific purposes in the codebase. The only temporary deviation is in generated JavaScript files, which will be resolved when the application is rebuilt.
