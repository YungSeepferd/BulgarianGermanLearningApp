## ⏱️ TIME INVESTMENT BREAKDOWN

### Extraction Time by Phase

**Phase A1 (1,441 new words)**
```
1,441 words ÷ 100 words per hour = 14.4 hours extraction
+ 30% overhead (validation, dedup, formatting) = 19 hours
+ Testing & documentation = 26 hours total
≈ 3.25 working days or 1 week part-time
```

**Full Curriculum (5,913 new words)**
```
5,913 words ÷ 100 words per hour = 59 hours extraction
+ 30% overhead = 77 hours
+ Testing & documentation = 100 hours total
≈ 2 weeks full-time or 5 weeks part-time
```

### Cost Analysis (If Outsourced)

- Professional lexicographer: $50-100/hour
- Full curriculum: 100 hours × $75 = **$7,500**
