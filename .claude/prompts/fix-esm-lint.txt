Run `npm run lint:esm` and summarize the errors (ES module syntax and imports).

For each error that is straightforward to fix, provide a minimal unified-diff patch that only touches files under `assets/js/`.

Rules:
- Do not edit files outside `assets/js/`.
- If a fix is unclear or risky, describe the problem and propose a manual action instead of applying it.
- Keep diffs minimal and include a short explanation for each change.
