Scan `layouts/` and `assets/js/` for keyboard navigation and ARIA accessibility issues.

Produce:
- A short list of issues (max 8 items), each with a one-sentence severity and location.
- For each issue, provide either a one-file unified-diff patch or a one-paragraph code suggestion that a developer can apply.

Rules:
- Prioritize keyboard navigation, focus order, and ARIA roles.
- Avoid touching unrelated template code; prefer single-file patches.
