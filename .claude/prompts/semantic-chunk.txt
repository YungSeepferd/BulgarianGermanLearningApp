# Semantic chunking for vocabulary
# Input: vocabulary.json entries
# Output: Semantic groupings and relationship suggestions

Analyze vocabulary entries and suggest semantic groupings based on:
1. Core concepts and derived terms
2. Common usage contexts
3. Related grammatical patterns
4. Cultural/pragmatic connections

For each group, provide:
- Central concept/theme
- Member words/phrases
- Common contexts of use
- Learning progression order
- Cross-references to other groups

Rules:
1. Focus on natural language acquisition patterns
2. Consider both Bulgarian and German semantic fields
3. Note false friends and potential confusion points
4. Suggest memory hooks and learning strategies

Example desired output format:

Semantic Grouping Principles:
1. Time-based clusters (morning routine, daily activities)
2. Location-based clusters (home, work, transportation)
3. Action-based clusters (movement verbs, communication)
4. Theme-based clusters (food, weather, emotions)
5. Grammar-linked clusters (verbs with similar patterns)

DO NOT:
- Break existing category structures
- Ignore CEFR level progression
- Create arbitrary groupings without clear learning benefit
- Mix unrelated concepts just because they share grammar patterns
- Forget to include both Bulgarian and German forms
